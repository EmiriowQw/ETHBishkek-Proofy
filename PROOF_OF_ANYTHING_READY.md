## 📊 Database State (Mock Storage)

### Backend Arrays

```javascript
mockAchievements[]      // Your achievements
mockCustomCategories[]  // Custom categories you created
mockVerifiers[]         // Registered verifiers (empty for now)
mockVerificationRequests[] // Pending verifications
mockCertificates[]      // Claimed certificates

// Legacy (still works)
mockCourses[]          // Old courses system
```

### Check Backend State

```bash
# In backend terminal, you'll see logs like:
🎯 [BACKEND] Total achievements: 3
📂 [BACKEND] Custom categories: 1
🛡️ [BACKEND] Total verifiers: 0
```

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations (Current Phase)

1. **No Verifier Registration Page**
   - Can manually register via API: `POST /api/verifiers/register`
   - UI page not created yet

2. **Verification Panel Not Updated**
   - Exists for courses, needs achievement support
   - Category filtering not implemented in UI

3. **Dashboard Not Updated**
   - No "Create Achievement" button
   - Navigate manually to `/create-achievement`

4. **Certificates Page Basic**
   - Shows certificates but no category info
   - No category filtering

5. **No Navigation Links**
   - Routes work but not linked in nav
   - Manually type URLs for now

---

## 🎯 Testing URLs (Manual Navigation)

```
http://localhost:3000/create-achievement
http://localhost:3000/my-achievements
http://localhost:3000/my-courses (old system, still works)
http://localhost:3000/my-certificates
http://localhost:3000/verification (needs update)
```

---

## 💡 Quick Fixes to Make It More Usable

### Fix 1: Add Navigation Links

**File:** `pages/index.tsx`

```typescript
// Add in navigation or hero section:
<Link href="/create-achievement" className="btn-primary">
  🎯 Create Achievement
</Link>

<Link href="/my-achievements" className="text-gray-600 hover:text-primary-600">
  My Achievements
</Link>
```

### Fix 2: Add to My Achievements Nav

**File:** Already has nav, good to go!

### Fix 3: Test with API Directly

```powershell
# Create achievement
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/achievements/create `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{
    "title": "Test Achievement",
    "description": "Testing the API directly",
    "category": "education",
    "specificData": {"institution": "Test U"},
    "creatorAddress": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb"
  }'

# Get achievements
curl http://localhost:3001/api/achievements/my-achievements?address=0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb

# Get categories
