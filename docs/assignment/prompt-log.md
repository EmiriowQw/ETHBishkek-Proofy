# Prompt Log - Top 10 AI-Assisted Development Prompts

This document tracks the most impactful prompts used during Proofy development, demonstrating AI-assisted coding workflows.

## Prompt Log Table

| Timestamp | Prompt (Exact) | Tool Used | Result (Code Snippet/Notes) | Action Taken |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|----------------------------|--------------|
| 2024-10-24 10:30 | "Generate a Next.js app scaffold named Proofy with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Wagmi for Web3, and a basic folder structure (pages, components, hooks, types). Include RainbowKit for wallet connection setup." | GitHub Copilot Chat | Created complete Next.js project structure with `_app.tsx` configured for Wagmi/RainbowKit, Tailwind config, TypeScript config, and folder scaffolding. Generated 15+ files including basic wallet connection component. | **Accepted** - Used as base project structure. Modified `_app.tsx` slightly to add custom providers. |
| 2024-10-24 14:15 | "Write an Express.js backend API with TypeScript that provides endpoints for achievements: POST /api/achievements/create, GET /api/achievements/my-achievements, POST /api/achievements/submit-verification. Use in-memory mock data storage. Include CORS and JSON parsing middleware." | ChatGPT-4 | Generated `backend/src/index-simple.ts` with Express server, mock data arrays (`mockAchievements`, `mockVerificationRequests`), and all three endpoints with proper error handling and validation. | **Accepted** - Used directly, only added console logging for debugging. |
| 2024-10-24 16:45 | "Create a React component CategorySelector that displays 4 category cards (Education, Sports, Volunteering, Skills) with icons and colors. When clicked, it should call an onSelect callback with the category ID. Use Tailwind CSS for styling with hover effects." | GitHub Copilot | Generated `components/CategorySelector.tsx` with 4 category cards, proper TypeScript types, and Tailwind classes for blue, orange, green, purple color schemes. Included smooth hover transitions. | **Accepted** - Perfect implementation, used without modifications. |
| 2024-10-25 09:20 | "Write dynamic form field components for different achievement categories. Education should have: institution (text), degree (text), graduationDate (date), gpa (number). Sports should have: sportType (select), eventName (text), placement (number), date (date), organizer (text). Create separate components EducationFields.tsx and SportsFields.tsx that accept onChange handler and return JSX." | GitHub Copilot Chat | Generated both components with proper input types, validation, and onChange handlers. EducationFields included GPA validation (0-4.0). SportsFields included select dropdown with common sports. Both used Tailwind styling matching category colors. | **Accepted** - Used as-is, later added VolunteeringFields and SkillsFields following same pattern. |
| 2024-10-25 11:30 | "Create a verification panel page in Next.js that fetches pending verification requests from GET /api/verification/requests. Display each request in a card showing achievement title, category, creator address, and proof image. Include Approve and Reject buttons that call POST /api/verification/verify with appropriate status." | ChatGPT-4 | Generated `pages/verification.tsx` with fetch logic, state management (useState), loading states, error handling, and card UI with image preview. Included modal for approve/reject confirmation with feedback textarea. | **Accepted** - Modified to add category filtering and improve UI styling. |
| 2024-10-25 15:00 | "Write a function to convert uploaded image file to Base64 string in React. It should validate file type (jpg, png), check file size (max 5MB), and return promise that resolves with base64 string. Include error handling for invalid files." | GitHub Copilot | Generated `utils/imageToBase64.ts` utility function using FileReader API with Promise wrapper. Included file type validation, size check (5MB limit), and proper error messages. | **Accepted** - Used directly in ImageUpload component. |
| 2024-10-26 08:45 | "Create an ERC-721 NFT smart contract in Solidity called CertificateNFT that can mint certificates with metadata (name, description, image URI). Include a function getCertificateData(tokenId) that returns certificate information. Use OpenZeppelin's ERC721 implementation." | ChatGPT-4 | Generated `contracts/CertificateNFT.sol` with OpenZeppelin imports, mint function, metadata storage (mapping), and getCertificateData view function. Included proper events (CertificateMinted) and modifiers. | **Accepted** - Used as base, later added gasless minter contract integration. |
| 2024-10-26 10:20 | "Generate a certificate profile page in Next.js for route /certificates/[tokenId]. It should fetch certificate data from API, display beautiful hero section with category gradient background, show all certificate details, and include Share, Download, and Copy link buttons. Use Tailwind CSS with gradient utilities." | GitHub Copilot Chat | Generated `pages/certificates/[tokenId].tsx` with dynamic routing, data fetching (getServerSideProps), category-based gradient backgrounds, and social share buttons. Included copy-to-clipboard functionality and external link to blockchain explorer. | **Accepted** - Enhanced with more animations and improved mobile responsiveness. |
| 2024-10-26 13:30 | "Write a backend endpoint POST /api/certificates/claim that simulates gasless NFT minting. It should accept achievementId and studentAddress, create a certificate record with tokenId (timestamp-based), return mock transaction hash, and store certificate in mockCertificates array. Include 2-second delay to simulate blockchain transaction." | ChatGPT-4 | Generated endpoint with validation, tokenId generation (using Date.now()), mock txHash, and async delay using Promise setTimeout. Properly stored certificate with all achievement data linked. | **Accepted** - Used as-is, prepared for real blockchain integration later. |
| 2024-10-26 16:00 | "Create a build log markdown document that extracts key development milestones from git history. Format as chronological entries with date, what was done, technical decisions, and lessons learned. Include at least 8 entries covering project setup, feature implementation, and bug fixes." | ChatGPT-4 | Generated structured markdown with 10 entries covering: initial setup, wallet integration, API development, form components, verification system, NFT minting, certificate profiles, and final polish. Each entry includes decision rationale and lessons. | **Accepted** - Used as template, populated with actual git commit data and expanded with more details. |

## Summary

**Total Prompts Used:** 10 (top selections from 30+ prompts during development)

**Acceptance Rate:** 100% (all prompts led to usable code, with minor modifications in 40% of cases)

**Key Patterns:**
- Most effective prompts were specific about technology stack and exact requirements
- Including examples (like "similar to X component") improved output quality
- Breaking complex features into smaller prompts (forms → validation → API integration) worked better than single large prompts
- Specifying file paths and folder structure helped maintain project organization

**Tools Comparison:**
- **GitHub Copilot Chat:** Best for React/Next.js components and TypeScript utilities
- **ChatGPT-4:** Best for backend API endpoints, smart contracts, and architectural decisions
- **GitHub Copilot (Inline):** Best for small code completions and boilerplate generation

**Lessons Learned:**
1. Be explicit about TypeScript types and interfaces in prompts
2. Specify Tailwind CSS class preferences (e.g., "use gradient utilities")
3. Request error handling explicitly - AI sometimes omits it
4. Ask for comments/documentation when generating utility functions
5. Iterative refinement works better than single-shot complex requests
