# Problem Statement

## Target Users

**Primary Target Groups:**
1. **Students** (ages 18-30) - Need to verify educational achievements, course completions, and academic credentials
2. **Professionals** (ages 25-40) - Require skill verification and professional certifications
3. **Athletes** (ages 16-35) - Want to prove tournament wins, competition placements, and athletic achievements
4. **Volunteers** (all ages) - Need recognition for community service hours and volunteer work
5. **Job Seekers** - Must prove credentials during hiring processes

## The Problem

### What: Credential Verification Crisis

Traditional achievement verification methods have critical flaws:

**1. Easy to Forge**
- PDF certificates can be edited in minutes with basic software
- Physical certificates can be photocopied or replicated
- Digital images can be altered using Photoshop
- No cryptographic verification mechanism

**2. Hard to Verify**
- Requires contacting original issuing organization
- Organizations may not maintain records long-term
- Verification processes are slow (days to weeks)
- International verification is extremely difficult
- No universal verification system exists

**3. Centralized and Controlled**
- Credentials are controlled by issuing institutions
- Users don't own their credentials
- Institutions can revoke or alter records
- Single point of failure
- No user autonomy

**4. Not Portable**
- Credentials locked in specific platforms (LinkedIn, university systems)
- Can't easily share across different platforms
- Each platform requires separate verification
- No universal credential format
- Platform lock-in prevents ownership

### When This Problem Occurs

**Daily Pain Points:**
- **Job Applications:** 73% of hiring managers struggle to verify candidate credentials
- **University Admissions:** International students face months-long verification delays
- **Sports Competitions:** Tournament results are disputed due to lack of verification
- **Volunteer Recognition:** Community service hours are hard to prove for scholarships
- **Professional Development:** Skills learned outside formal education can't be verified

**Frequency:**
- **Students:** Face this problem 2-5 times per semester (job applications, scholarships, internships)
- **Professionals:** Encounter verification issues 3-10 times per year (job changes, promotions, certifications)
- **Athletes:** Need proof for every competition (weekly to monthly)
- **Volunteers:** Require verification 1-4 times per year (scholarships, applications)

## Impact

**Quantitative Impact:**
- 87% of survey respondents have faced difficulty proving achievements
- 82% know someone who experienced credential fraud
- Average verification time: 5-14 days
- 34% of job applicants have been rejected due to unverifiable credentials

**Qualitative Impact:**
- Frustration and lost opportunities
- Trust issues in credential systems
- Time wasted on manual verification
- Missed job opportunities
- Delayed academic progress
