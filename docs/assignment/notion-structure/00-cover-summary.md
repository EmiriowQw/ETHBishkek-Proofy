# Proofy - Universal Achievement Verification Platform

## One-Liner Summary

**Proofy** is a Web3 platform that enables anyone to create, verify, and own blockchain-secured NFT certificates for achievements across any domain (education, sports, volunteering, professional skills), eliminating credential fraud through expert verification and immutable blockchain records.

## Project Overview

Proofy solves the critical problem of credential verification and authenticity. Traditional achievements (diplomas, competition certificates, volunteer hours, skill certifications) are easily forged, hard to verify, centralized, and not portable across platforms. Proofy addresses this by combining:

1. **Expert Verification System** - Human experts review and validate achievements
2. **Blockchain Technology** - Immutable NFT certificates stored on-chain
3. **Universal Categories** - Support for any achievement type, not limited to one domain
4. **Gasless Minting** - Users don't pay blockchain fees, making it accessible
5. **Beautiful UX** - Portfolio-ready certificate profiles with share functionality

## Quick Stats
