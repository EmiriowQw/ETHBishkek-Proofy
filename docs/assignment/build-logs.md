## 2024-10-24 09:00 - Project Initialization

**What was done:**
- Initialized Next.js 14 project with TypeScript
- Configured Tailwind CSS with custom theme
- Set up Wagmi and RainbowKit for Web3 wallet connection
- Created basic folder structure: `pages/`, `components/`, `hooks/`, `types/`
- Configured `_app.tsx` with Web3 providers

**Technical Decisions:**
- Chose Next.js over Create React App for better performance and SEO
- Selected Wagmi v1 for stable Web3 hooks (v2 was too new at time)
- RainbowKit for wallet connection UI (better UX than manual connection)
- TypeScript strict mode enabled for type safety

**Lessons Learned:**
- RainbowKit requires specific chain configuration - had to add Status Network chain manually
- Wagmi providers must wrap entire app in `_app.tsx`, not individual pages

## 2024-10-24 14:00 - Backend API Setup

**What was done:**
- Created Express.js backend with TypeScript
- Set up CORS, helmet, morgan middleware
- Implemented mock data storage (in-memory arrays)
- Created first API endpoints: `/health`, `/api/categories`, `/api/achievements/create`

**Technical Decisions:**
- Used in-memory storage instead of database for MVP speed
- Chose Express over FastAPI/NestJS for simplicity and Node.js ecosystem consistency
- Mock data structure designed to easily migrate to PostgreSQL later
- Port 3001 for backend to avoid conflicts with Next.js default (3000)

**Lessons Learned:**
- CORS configuration crucial - frontend on different port caused issues initially
- Mock data persists only during server runtime - acceptable for demo, not production
- Express JSON body parser needs size limit (10mb) for image uploads

## 2024-10-24 16:30 - Category System Implementation

**What was done:**
- Created 4 predefined categories with field definitions
- Built CategorySelector component with visual cards
- Implemented dynamic form rendering based on category selection
- Created category-specific field components (EducationFields, SportsFields)

**Technical Decisions:**
- Used color-coded UI (blue, orange, green, purple) for visual distinction
- Dynamic form fields stored in category definition (array of field names)
- Component composition pattern: base form + category-specific fields
- Emoji icons for categories (better visual recognition than generic icons)

**Lessons Learned:**
- Dynamic forms require careful TypeScript typing - used `Record<string, any>` for specificData
- Category colors must be accessible (contrast ratios checked)
- Field validation should be category-aware (e.g., GPA 0-4.0, not 0-100)

---

## 2024-10-25 09:00 - Achievement Creation Flow

**What was done:**
- Built achievement creation wizard page (`/create-achievement`)
- Implemented multi-step form: category selection → form filling → image upload
- Added form validation (required fields, min/max lengths)
- Connected to backend API for achievement creation
- Added draft status - achievements saved but not submitted

**Technical Decisions:**
- Wizard pattern for better UX (progressive disclosure)
- Draft functionality allows users to save incomplete achievements
- Base64 image encoding for easy storage/transmission (prepares for blockchain/IPFS)
- Client-side validation first, server-side validation as backup

**Lessons Learned:**
- Large Base64 images can cause performance issues - need compression in future
- Form state management complex with dynamic fields - used React useState effectively
- Draft status prevents accidental loss of user input

---

## 2024-10-25 13:00 - Verification System Backend

**What was done:**
- Created verifier registration endpoint
- Implemented verification request submission
- Built verification queue system with filtering
- Added approve/reject functionality with feedback

**Technical Decisions:**
- Role-based access: verifiers stored separately from achievements
- Verification requests as separate entities (not just achievement status)
- Category-based filtering for verifiers (expertise specialization)
- Feedback required for rejections (better user experience)

**Lessons Learned:**
- Verifier addresses must be different from achievement creators (prevent self-verification)
- Verification queue should show most recent first
- Filtering by category reduces verifier cognitive load

---

## 2024-10-25 15:30 - Verification Panel Frontend

**What was done:**
- Built verification panel page (`/verification`)
- Created achievement review cards with proof image display
- Implemented approve/reject modals with feedback forms
- Added category filtering dropdown
- Real-time status updates after verification

**Technical Decisions:**
- Modal dialogs for approve/reject actions (prevent accidental clicks)
- Large proof image preview (helps verifiers make informed decisions)
- Category filter shows only relevant achievements to each verifier
- Toast notifications for verification success/failure

**Lessons Learned:**
- Image preview must handle Base64 data URLs correctly (add `data:image/...` prefix)
- Modal should disable background scroll
- Feedback textarea should have min character requirement (prevent lazy rejections)

## 2024-10-26 08:00 - Smart Contracts Development

**What was done:**
- Created CertificateNFT.sol (ERC-721 contract)
- Implemented GaslessMinter.sol for fee abstraction
- Set up Hardhat development environment
- Configured Status Network deployment scripts

**Technical Decisions:**
- OpenZeppelin contracts for security (battle-tested code)
- Separate gasless minter contract (allows backend to pay gas)
- Metadata stored on-chain (small) with IPFS links (prepared for future)
- Token ID generation using timestamp (ensures uniqueness)

**Lessons Learned:**
- Gasless minting requires contract to hold ETH balance
- ERC-721 standard provides events needed for frontend tracking
- Hardhat config must include Status Network RPC endpoints

---

## 2024-10-26 11:00 - NFT Certificate Claiming

**What was done:**
- Implemented certificate claim endpoint (simulated gasless minting)
- Built "Claim Certificate" button in My Achievements page
- Created certificate gallery page (`/my-certificates`)
- Added certificate display cards with metadata

**Technical Decisions:**
- Simulated minting for MVP (backend generates tokenId, returns mock txHash)
- Certificate storage in mockCertificates array (links to achievement)
- Claim button only appears for verified achievements
- Token ID format: sequential numbers for demo, timestamps for uniqueness

**Lessons Learned:**
- Users need clear feedback during minting process (loading states)
- Certificate should show all achievement data (not just title)
- Gallery should handle empty state gracefully

---

## 2024-10-26 14:00 - Certificate Profile Pages

**What was done:**
- Created dynamic route `/certificates/[tokenId]`
- Built beautiful profile page with category gradients
- Implemented Share, Download, Copy link functionality
- Added blockchain explorer link (prepared for real transactions)

**Technical Decisions:**
- Category-based gradient backgrounds (visual consistency)
- Hero section for impressive first impression
- Share functionality uses Web Share API (native on mobile)
- Download generates PNG image (future: PDF certificate)

**Lessons Learned:**
- Dynamic routes require getServerSideProps for data fetching
- Gradient backgrounds must be readable (text contrast)
- Copy-to-clipboard API requires HTTPS (or localhost)

## 2024-10-26 16:00 - Polish & Bug Fixes

**What was done:**
- Fixed status update delays (added auto-refresh)
- Improved mobile responsiveness
- Added loading skeletons
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Created comprehensive documentation

**Technical Decisions:**
- Auto-refresh every 10 seconds for pending achievements (UX improvement)
- Skeleton screens instead of spinners (perceived performance)
- Error boundaries for React error handling
- Toast notifications for all user actions

**Lessons Learned:**
- Status updates need polling or WebSocket for real-time (chose polling for simplicity)
- Mobile UX requires larger touch targets
- Error messages should be actionable ("Try again" button)
- Documentation saves time during demo/presentation

---

## 2024-10-26 17:30 - Final Testing & Submission Prep

**What was done:**
- End-to-end testing of complete flow (create → verify → claim)
- Tested with 2 MetaMask accounts (student + verifier roles)
- Verified all API endpoints working
- Created submission documentation and checklist
- Prepared demo video script

**Technical Decisions:**
- Two-wallet testing approach (simulates real-world usage)
- Mock data reset on server restart (acceptable for demo)
- All features functional for hackathon presentation

**Lessons Learned:**
- Testing with real wallets catches Web3 integration issues
- Demo flow should be practiced (timing matters)
- Documentation completeness critical for judges
